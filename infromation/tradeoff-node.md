## üëÄ Overview of TradeOFF Node Benefits

On the TradeOFF platform, node holders enjoy multiple benefits, including mining rewards, community incentives, staking commissions, bond revenue sharing, and Martingale strategy profit sharing. Here is a detailed description of node benefits:

### ‚õèÔ∏è Mining Rewards

**Token Output:** 2.5 million tokens in the first year (6,850 tokens daily), decreasing by 25% annually for a total of 30 years.

**Reward Distribution:** The number of tokens staked by the node / total number of staked tokens \* daily output of tokens.

### üë• Community Incentives

In addition to mining rewards, node holders can earn community incentives. The amount of the incentive is proportional to the community's activity level, encouraging node holders to actively participate in community building.

#### Staking

Node holders have the right to set a commission rate (5%-10%). Community members who participate in staking need to share part of their earnings with the node holders.

#### Token

Node holders can also benefit from the community bond revenue-sharing mechanism, allowing them to receive 2% of the transaction volume from bond trades within the node community network. This reward is distributed in tokens and released linearly over 7 days.

#### Martingale Strategy

Additionally, node holders have the right to share 5% of the profits when community members initiate the Martingale strategy. If a node is revoked, this portion of the profits will be used as an ecological fee for future platform development.

## üíµ Node Pricing

### Early Pre-Sale

Participating in the pre-sale allows you to purchase a node at a discounted price of 10,000 USDT each, receiving 50,000 tokens. The number of nodes is limited to 100.

#### Pre-Sale Benefits

When you recommend others to purchase using your node referral link, you will receive a one-time cash rebate of 20% USDT of the total sales from the recommended nodes.

### Post Pre-Sale

After the pre-sale, you can still become a node holder. However, the node price will be dynamic, requiring a certain amount of tokens to be staked, and there will be no pre-sale referral cash rebate.

## üì∂ Node Functions

### **Liquidity Delegation:**

* Users can delegate their assets to nodes to participate in liquidity mining and other yield strategies.
* Nodes are responsible for the optimal allocation of the delegated liquidity to maximize returns.

### **Staking to Set Up a Node:**

* Users can set up a node by staking 10,000 TRO tokens and enjoy node profit sharing.
* Node owners can set rates to charge fees from the liquidity mining output and yields of the delegated assets.

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Node Benefits

### **Token Distribution:**

* 20% of TRO tokens are distributed to nodes over 5 years.
* 60% of TRO tokens are distributed to effective liquidity providers over 20 years.
* The remaining TRO tokens are allocated for team development, institutional financing, and initial liquidity.

### **Profit Sharing:**

* Nodes can set a fee rate of 3%-10% to charge from the TRO rewards generated by delegated liquidity mining.
* Nodes can set a fee rate of 5%-20% to charge from the yield rewards generated by delegated assets.
* The ecosystem can incentivize nodes through a reward mechanism (e.g., distributing a portion of market growth rewards to nodes) to promote ecosystem usage.

* One-click operation to allocate unallocated liquidity to participate in the Martingale strategy trading.

### **Fee Rate Setting:**

* Set a 3%-10% fee on the platform token rewards generated by delegated liquidity.
* Set a 5%-20% fee on the yield rewards generated by delegated liquidity, which will be automatically deducted when entering the yield liquidity pool.

### **Earnings Withdrawal:**

* Withdraw TRO rewards.
* Withdraw USDT yield sharing rewards.

## ü™ô Decentralized Asset Management

1. **Decision Autonomy**: Node managers can formulate investment strategies based on their own judgment and market insights, free from the constraints of centralized institutions.
2. **Operational Transparency**: All fund flows and investment operations are recorded publicly on the blockchain, allowing anyone to verify them in real time, thus eliminating the potential for opaque operations that might occur in centralized institutions.
3. **Risk Diversification**: Multiple nodes operate simultaneously, effectively avoiding the risk of single points of failure, thereby enhancing the overall stability and security of the system.
4. **Inclusiveness**: The decentralized structure allows more participants to join the asset management field, breaking down the entry barriers of traditional finance.

## üßæ Node Pricing

* The first batch of nodes is publicly sold at $5,000 each, with a total of 300 nodes available for 60 days.
* During the public sale, 80% of each USDT revenue will be used to purchase Bitcoin (as decided by foundation governance).
* Subsequent public sale rounds may be added depending on the situation. After completing all public sale rounds, setting up new nodes will require staking 10,000 TRO tokens. For every 5 new nodes added to the network, the required TRO stake will increase by 2%.

### **Repurchase Clause:**

* Within the first 30 days, nodes can trigger the repurchase clause to receive Bitcoin corresponding to 80% of the initial purchase amount, not exceeding the original $5,000 spent.
* The Bitcoin amount for repurchase decreases by 8% every subsequent 30 days.

## ‚ú® Advantages

* **Multiple Earnings:** Nodes can earn liquidity mining rewards and charge fees from delegated yield profits through liquidity delegation and staking.
* **Flexible Management:** Nodes provide various operational methods to facilitate liquidity allocation and maximize earnings.
* **High Transparency:** All node operations and earnings distribution are automatically executed through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and fairness.

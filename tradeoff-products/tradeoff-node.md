## Node Functions

1. **Liquidity Delegation**:
   * Users can delegate their assets to nodes to participate in liquidity mining.
   * Nodes are responsible for allocating the delegated liquidity to maximize returns.
2. **Staking to Set Up Nodes**:
   * Users can set up nodes by staking 10,000 TRO tokens and enjoy profit sharing.
   * Node owners can set rates to earn a share from the delegated liquidity mining rewards and investment returns.

## Node Rights

1. **Token Distribution**:
   * 20% of TRO tokens will be distributed to nodes over 5 years.
   * 60% of TRO tokens will be distributed to effective liquidity providers over 20 years.
   * The remaining TRO tokens are allocated for team development, institutional financing, and initial liquidity.
2. **Profit Sharing**:
   * Nodes can set a rate of 3%-10% to earn a share of the TRO rewards generated from delegated liquidity mining.
   * Nodes can set a rate of 5%-20% to earn a share of the profits from delegated liquidity investments.
   * Ecosystem rewards can incentivize nodes to promote the ecosystem's usage.

## Node Management

1. **Node Settings**:
   * Set a rate of 3%-10% to earn a share from the liquidity mining rewards (platform tokens).
   * Set a rate of 5%-20% to earn a share from the liquidity investment returns, which will be automatically deducted when entering the revenue pool.
   * Set the position pool ratio to maintain a portion of the funds for user redemption needs.
2. **Node Configuration**:
   * Nodes can set multiple administrator addresses, with different administrators handling tasks such as fundraising, investing, and risk control. The specific division of labor is decided by the node.
   * Nodes exist in NFT form and can be transferred, allowing node ownership to be easily transferred between users.
3. **Earnings Withdrawal**:
   * Withdrawal of TRO rewards.
   * Withdrawal of USDT profit-sharing rewards.

## Pricing

### **Public Sale**

1. The first batch of nodes will be sold publicly for $5000 each, with a total of 300 nodes, and the public sale period will be 60 days.
2. During the public sale, 80% of each USDT income will be used to purchase Bitcoin (as determined by the foundation's governance).
3. Additional public sale rounds may be added as needed. After completing all public sale rounds, setting up new nodes will require staking 10,000 TRO tokens. For every 5 additional nodes in the network, the amount of TRO required for staking will increase by 2%.

### **Buyback Terms**

1. Within the first 30 days, nodes can be repurchased with the corresponding Bitcoin value (80%) at the time of purchase, with a maximum return value not exceeding 100% of the USDT spent to buy the node (i.e., even if Bitcoin doubles in value, the return value remains $5000 in Bitcoin).
2. The corresponding Bitcoin return amount will decrease by 8% every 30 days thereafter.

## Advantages

1. **Autonomous Decision-Making**: Node managers can formulate investment strategies based on their own judgment and market insights without restrictions from centralized institutions.
2. **Transparent Operations**: All fund flows and investment operations are publicly recorded on the blockchain, allowing real-time inspection by anyone, eliminating potential opacity of centralized institutions.
3. **Risk Diversification**: Multiple nodes operate simultaneously, effectively avoiding single point of failure risks, enhancing the system's overall stability and security.
4. **Inclusiveness**: The decentralized structure allows more participants to join the asset management field, breaking down traditional financial entry barriers.

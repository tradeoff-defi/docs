### **📱 User Delegates Liquidity:**

* Users delegate their liquidity assets to nodes for mining.
* Alternatively, users can choose to directly participate in the platform's ecosystem mining.

### **📶 Node Operations:**

* After receiving the user's liquidity assets, nodes deposit them into a principal pool.
* Funds in the principal pool are partially allocated for trading and invested in various ecosystem clusters, including third-party and self-built ecosystem products such as Aave, JasperVault, and Martingale.

### **💸 Earnings Pool:**

* A portion of the earnings generated by the ecosystem clusters goes into the earnings pool.
* Funds in the earnings pool, after deducting earnings-related fees, are distributed to users according to a specific ratio.

### **💰 User Earnings:**

* Users can withdraw their principal and earnings at any time.
* The principal is withdrawn directly from the principal pool, while earnings are withdrawn from the earnings pool.

## **✨ Advantages of Liquidity Mining**

* **High Returns**: By participating in ecosystem mining, users can earn additional TRO token rewards and profit shares.
* **High Flexibility**: Users can choose to delegate mining to nodes or participate on their own, allowing for flexible investment strategies.
* **Security and Transparency**: All operations are executed through smart contracts, ensuring the security of funds and transparency of operations.
